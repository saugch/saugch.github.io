# Poincaré map
Consider $$x' = f(x), \quad x \in U \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$$ (a continous dynamical system).

- A first method to obtain a discrete DS from the previous continuous one is by taking its time-T flow. This means, integrating and then checking the points every T times.![[cont_to_discrete1]]
- Another method, which is very convenient in some situations, is through a **Poincaré section**.

###### Poincaré section | def
Let $\Sigma$ be a hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (typically given by $g(x) = 0$) and assume also it is transversal to the vector field, that is the vector field is not tangent to $\Sigma$ at any point of $\Sigma$. In other words, $\forall x \in \Sigma$, $\nabla g(x) \not\perp f(x)$, i.e., $<\nabla g(x), f(x)> \neq 0$.

Example, imagine $n=3$. We consider $x \in \Sigma$, and $\nabla g(x) = \left( \frac{\partial g(x)}{\partial x_{1}},\dots, \frac{\partial g(x)}{\partial x_{n}} \right)$ . Since $f(x)$ defines the tangent space, $f(x)$ and $\nabla g(x)$ cannot be perpendicular.

##### Poincaré map | def
Assume $x_0$ given (may belong to $\Sigma$ or not) and assume $\phi(T, x_{0})\in \Sigma$ for $T_{0}>0$ (and minimum with this property). For different $x_0$, we will need different $T_0$ to obtain this property.

Assume a neighbourhood of $x_0$, $U$, and a map,
$$\begin{aligned}\tau: U &\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
x &\longrightarrow \tau(x)\end{aligned}$$
known as **time-return map** such thatt $\phi(\tau(x), x) \in \Sigma$,  $\forall x \in U$ .
![[poincaré_map]]

The map $P(x) = \phi(\tau(x), x)$ is called **Poincaré map** (or first return map).

###### Remarks
1. We may have the situation: $P: \Sigma \longrightarrow \Sigma$. *And you can analyze the solutions of the Poincaré orbit thorugh this map.* For example, if you want to compute a periodic orbit, you can compute a fixed point of the Poincaré map.![[poincare_map2]]
2. We may have the situation: $P: \Sigma_{1} \longrightarrow \Sigma_{2}$ so here we have some $g_{1}(x) = 0$ defining $\Sigma_{1}$ and same for $g_2(x)$.

#### Numerical computation of the Poincaré map
We have $x$ (belonging to $\Sigma$ or not) and we want $P(x) = \phi(\tau(x), x)$, so we need to compute the necessary time $\tau(x)$ to reach $\Sigma$ (given by $g(x)$).

We want $0 = g(P(x)) = g(\phi(\tau(x), x))$ ,
so we want to solve $G(t) = g(\phi(t(x), x)) = 0$ ($t$ and $\tau$ here are the same).

We apply Newton's method: we start with $t^{0}$ (which is **not** the initial time, it's the seed to start Newton's method) and we compute this sequence of values of $t$:
$$t^{m+1} = t^{m} - \frac{G(t^{m})}{G'(t^{m})}, \quad m \geq 0$$which will tend to $\tau(x)$. $G$ is known. And $G'$ is the derivative of $G(t)$ with respect to time:
$$G'(t) = Dg(\phi(t(x), x))\frac{d\phi}{dt} = Dg(\phi(t(x), x))f(\phi(t,x)) = <\nabla g(\phi(t(x), x)), f(\phi(t(x), x))>$$
So we have

$$t^{m+1} = t^{m} - \frac{G(t^{m})}{G'(t^{m})} = t^{m} - \frac{G(t^{m})}{<\nabla g(\phi(t(x), x)), f(\phi(t(x), x))>}$$,with $\Delta t = \frac{G(t^{m})}{<\nabla g(\phi(t(x), x)), f(\phi(t(x), x))>}$.

Here is where we use that $\Sigma$ must not be transversal to the flow (otherwise it'd be 0).

You compute the time evolution of $x$ and compute $g_0$ and $g_1$ and it's product. It's positive (so both have the same sign), until it's not. Then, the moment the product is negative, you have the $t^0$ and then you use the previous formula to get an increment (if you have passed slightly the surface, you'll get a negative increment). Then you have a new time, you compute the increment, etc.

When are you at the right point? When $\Delta t < tol$. With tolerance usually around $10^{-14}$.

###### Remark: Differential of the Poincaré map
Let us compute the differential of the Poincaré map.
$$ \begin{aligned}P(x) &= \phi(\tau(x), x) \\
DP(x) &= \frac{d}{dt} \phi(\tau, x) D_{x}\tau(x) + D_{x}\phi(\tau(x), x) = f(\phi(\tau, x)) D\tau(x) + D \phi(\tau, x)\end{aligned}$$
We know how to compute everything except for $D \tau(x)$.

*Exercise*: We need 
$$D \tau(x) = \left(\frac{\partial \tau(x)}{\partial x_{1}}, \dots, \frac{\partial \tau(x)}{\partial x_{n}} \right) = - \frac{Dg(P(x))\cdot D \phi(\tau(x), x)}{Dg(P(x))\cdot f(P(x))}$$
compute the steps inbetween.

Finally, 

$$DP(x)= - f(P(x))\frac{Dg(P(x))\cdot D \phi(\tau(x), x)}{Dg(P(x))\cdot f(P(x))} + D\phi(\tau(x), x)$$

### Poincaré map and section
$\Sigma : g(x) = 0 \quad x\in U \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$
$$P(x) = \phi(\tau(x), x) \in \Sigma$$
$$DP(x)= -f((x)) \frac{Dg(P(x))\cdot D\phi(\tau(x), x)}{Dg(P(x)) \cdot f(P(x))} + D\phi(\tau(x), x)$$
###### Example
$g(x) = g(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) = x_{n}$

Then,
$$Dg(x) = \nabla g(x) = (0, \dots, 0, 1)$$
$$Dg(P(x))\cdot f(P(x)) = (0, \dots, 0, 1)\cdot (f_{1}, \dots, f_{n})|_{P(x)} = f_{n}(P(x))$$
So then

$$\begin{aligned}
DP(x) &= \frac{-1}{f_{n}(P(x))}\begin{pmatrix}f_{1}\\ \vdots \\ f_{n}\end{pmatrix}\cdot (0, \dots, 0, 1) \cdot \begin{pmatrix}a_{11} & \dots & a_{1n} \\ \vdots & & \vdots \\ a_{n1} & \dots & a_{nn} + \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}a_{11} & \dots & a_{1n} \\ \vdots & & \vdots \\ a_{n1} & \dots & a_{nn} + \end{pmatrix}
\\
& \begin{pmatrix}a_{11} - \frac{f_1}{f_{n}}a_{n1} & \dots & a_{1n} - \frac{f_1}{f_{n}}a_{nn} \\ \vdots & & \vdots \\ a_{n-1, 1} -  - \frac{f_{n-1}}{f_{n}}a_{n1} & \dots & a_{n-1,n}  - \frac{f_{n-1}}{f_{n}}a_{nn} \\ 0 & \dots & 0\end{pmatrix}\end{aligned}$$
