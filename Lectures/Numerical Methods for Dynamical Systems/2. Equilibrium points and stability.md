# Chapter 2: Equilibrium points and stability
###### Def: Stability
We say that **a solution** $x(t; t_{0}, x_{0})$ of $x' = f(t, x)$, $x\in U\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$, is stable if $\forall \epsilon  > 0 \quad \exists \delta(\epsilon, t_0)>0$,  
such that for any solution $y(t; t_{0}, x_{1})$ with $||x_{1}- x_{0}||<\delta$ is defined for $[t_{0}, \infty)$ and $||x(t; t_{0}, x_{0}) - y(t; t_{0,}x_{1})||<\epsilon$

> Everything should be in vector notation

![[ex_stable_solution]]
*You can draw a tube around an specific solution $x(t; t_{0}, x_{0})$ so that any initial condition inside the tube, its solution remains inside this defined tube.*

If, moreover, $\lim_{t \to \infty }{||x(t; t_{0}, x_{0} - y(t; t_{0}, x_{1})||} = 0$, we say that the solution $x(t; t_{0}, x_{0})$ is asymptotically stable.

The solution $x(t; t_{0}, x_{0})$ is **unstable** if it is not stable.

###### Def: Equilibrium point
$x = p$ for $x'=f(x)$, then $f(p)= 0$, that is $x(t) = p$ is a solution for all time.

>**Numerical computation of equilibrium points**
Given the system of ODEs, we must apply some method to solve $f(x) = 0$, using Netwon or whatever.

### Stability of an equilibrium point
For $p$ an equilibrim point of $x' = f(x)$,
consider an initial condition $p+\delta$, $\delta$ "small", the corresponding solution is 
$$\begin{align*}
\phi_{t}(p + \delta) &= \phi_{t}(p)+ D\phi_{t}(p)\delta + O(\delta^{2})\\
& \qquad p 
&\end{align*} 
$$
$D\phi_t(p)$ is the solution of the 1st order variational equation:
$$\begin{cases}
\frac{d}{dt}D\phi_{t}(p) = Df(\phi_{t}(p))D\phi_{t}(p) \\
(D\phi_{t}(p))|_{t=0} = I
\end{cases}$$
where $Df(\phi_{t}(p))$ with $\phi_{t}(p) = p$ is a constant matrix.

The solution is $D\phi_{t}(p) = e^{At}$, so $\phi_{t}(p+\delta) = p + e^{At}\delta + O(\delta^2)$.

The eigenvalues of $A$ "will decide" the stability of $p$

###### Def: Characteristic exponents
The eigenvalues of $A = Df(p)$ are called **characteristic exponents**

###### Def: Hyperbolic matrix or equilibrium points
If there is **no** eigenvalue with zero real part, then the matrix $A$ is called **hyperbolic** or the equilibrim point is called **hyperbolic**

###### Def: Elliptic matrix or equilibrium points
If all eigenvalues are purely imaginary and the associated [[Jordan matrix]] is diagonal, then $A$ or $p$ is called **elliptic**.


### Theorem: Stability of equilibrim points in an autonomous linear system of ODE
Consider $$x' = A(x-p)$$$A$ a matrix ($n\times n$), $x = p$ is an equilibrium point.
Taking $y=x-p$, the system becomes $y' = Ay$.

- (i) If all the eigenvalues of $A$ satisfy that $Re(\lambda)<0$, then $p$ is **asymptotically stable**.
- (ii) If there exists eigenvalues with $Re(\lambda) = 0$ and they are semisimple (that is that the corresponding Jordan block is diagonal) and the remaining eigenvalues satisfy tht $Re(\lambda) < 0$, then $p$ is **stable** (but not asymptotically stable)
- (iii) In any other situation, $p$ is **unstable**

#### Examples
$n = 2$. *Exercise*: There are exactly 14 different phase portratis

#### Hyperbolic points example
Assume $x' = A(x-p)$ where the eigenvalues of $A$ are $\alpha > 0$ ($\vec{v}^+$) and $\beta > 0$ ($\vec{v}^-$)

We have $p$ with the two eigenvectors. $\vec{v}^+$ defines 2 branches, wich corresponds to the invariant unstable 1d manifold ($W^{u_{1}+}(p)$ and $W^{u_{1}-}(p)$). If we take a point in the semiline $W^{u_{1}+}(p)$, and we integrate backwards in time, we will tend to the equilibrium point.
For $\vec{v}^{-}$, we have an invariant stable 1d manifold with two branches $W^{s+}(p)$ and $W^{s-}(p)$
In total: 2 manifolds, 4 branches.
 ![[linear_manifolds]]
These are **hyperbolic equilibrium points**


#### Elliptic points example
Assume $x' = A(x-p)$ where the eigenvalues of $A$ are purely imaginary $\pm i\omega$ and eigenvectors $\vec{v}^{\pm} = \vec{r} \pm i\vec{s}$


###### Lemma
The solution of $$\begin{cases}
\vec{x}' &= A \vec{x}  \\
\vec{x}(0) &= \vec{x}_{0} = a_{0}\vec{r} + b_{0}\vec{s}
\end{cases}$$
is $\vec{x}(t) = a_{0}\vec{x}_{1}(t) + b_{0}\vec{x}_{2}(t)$, with $$\begin{cases}
\vec{x}_{1}(t) = \vec{r} \cos{\omega t} - \vec{s} \sin{\omega t} \\
\vec{x}_{2}(t) = \vec{r} \sin{\omega t} + \vec{s} \cos{\omega t}
\end{cases}$$
The period of this solutions will be $\frac{2\pi}{w}$

If I take another system similar to this one, it makes sense that if you have eigenvalues like the first case, it seems reasonable that the eigenvalues will be similar. But for the second case, when you perturbe it a bit, you may get another thing. This means that the case 1 is more robust.

The hyperbolic euqilibrium points are very useful in the following sense. 

### Theorem: Hartman
Assume $x' = f(x)$, $p$ is a hyperbolic equilibrium point and $f \subset \mathcal{C}^k$. Then the local flow around $p$ is "equivalent" to the linear flow $x' = A(x-p)$, $A = Df(p)$ around $x = p$.

###### Example
The spectrum of A $spec A = \{\lambda, \beta\}$ (spectrum means the set of eigenvalues), with $\lambda>0$, $\beta < 0$. From a dynamical point of view, it's equivalent to have invariant lines ore invariant curves.
> This will be key to compute the real curves.

##### Theorem: Stability of equilibrium points for a nonlinear system of ODE
$x' = f(x)$, $x \in U \subset \mathbf{R}^n$, $f\subset \mathcal{C}^k(U)$,  and an equilibrium point, $f(p) = 0$ and $A = Df(p)$

- (i) If all the eigenvalues of $A$ satisfy $Re(\lambda)<0$, then $p$ is **asympotatically stable** for the nonlinear system.
- (ii) If there exists an eigenvalue such that $Re(\lambda) > 0$, then $p$ is **unstable** for the nonlinear system.
For the other possibilities we don't know, we cannot conclude.

###### Examples
**Example 1**
$$\begin{cases}
x' &= -y + ax(x^{2}+y^2) \\ \\
y' &= x + ay(x^{2}+ y^{2})
\end{cases}$$
For $p=(0, 0)$ and equilibrium point,

$$A = Df(x, y)|_{(0,0)} = \begin{pmatrix}0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$$
The eigenvalues are:
	$\det{(A - \lambda \mathbb{I})} = \lambda^{2}+1 \rightarrow \lambda = \pm i$

We cannot apply the theorem for this case. For the **linearized system**, $(0, 0)$ is a center.

For the nonlinear system, we will see that he orbits have the following shape depending on $a$ :
- For $a<0$, we have a stable point and the orbits are an inward spiral (towards the center).
- For $a=0$, we have a center.
- For $a>0$, we have an unstable point and the orbits are an outward spiral (from the center towards the outside).![[2. Equilibrium points and stability 2022-11-13 17.05.42.excalidraw]]

**Example 2: The pendulum** (Assignment)
$$\begin{cases}
\frac{d\theta}{dt} &= \omega  \\
\frac{d\omega}{dt} &= - \frac{g}{l}\sin\theta
\end{cases}$$
1. Equilibrium points
2. Stability of the equilibrium points taking into account the linearized system. At some points (e.g. $(\pi, 0)$ we can apply the theorem and at others like $(0, 0)$ we cannot)
3. Plot the phase portrait (orbits and direction)
	*Hint*: Use the first integral: $E = \frac{ml^{2}\omega^{2}}{2} + mgl(1-\cos{\theta})$
4. Energy level for the heteroclinic orbits (the ones that connect the unstable points in $(-\pi, 0)$ and $(\pi, 0)$)

**Example 3: Lotka-Volterra**
Model of competition between two species:

$$\begin{cases}
x' &= x(3-x-2y) \\
y' &= y(2-x-y) 
\end{cases}$$
$$DF = \begin{pmatrix}3-2x-2y & -2x \\-y  & 2-x-2y\end{pmatrix}$$

with
- $x(t)$: population of rabbits
- $y(t)$: population of sheep
(so $x, y \geq 0$)

1. Prove that the axes are invariant lines
2. Compute the equilibrium points
3. Classify them according to the linearized system (each point has a name, e.g. saddle, center, etc.)
4. Stability of the equilibrium points (from the linearized system)
5. Plot the local phase space around each equilibrium point
> So far, this can be done by hand
6. Plot the global phase space in $x, y \geq 0$
7. Are there homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits. 
8. In particular, compute the heteroclinic orbit from $(1, 1)$ to $(0, 0)$ (we can do it with what's explained below)
9. Describe shortly a biological interpretation of the results

The 9-points can be done by hand, but specially for 8 is better with computer. 

## Invariant manifolds
> It will play a key role from now to the end of this master's course. Ref: Meyer-Hall book

Assume we have this non-linear system of ODE's:
	$x'=f(x)$, $x\in U\subset \mathbf{R}^{n}$, $f$ smooth, $p$ is a *hyperbolic equilibrium point* (the Jacobian matrix at this equilibrium point has no eigenvalue with real part equal to 0).

###### Local stable manifold
Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given, then **the local stable manifold** is
$$W^{s}_{loc}(\varepsilon) = \{x\in \mathbb{R}^{n} \quad ||\phi(t, x) - p|| < \varepsilon, \textrm{ for } t\geq 0\}$$
###### Local unstable manifold
Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given, then **the local unstable manifold** is
$$W^{u}_{loc}(\varepsilon) = \{x\in \mathbb{R}^{n} \quad ||\phi(t, x) - p|| < \varepsilon, \textrm{ for } t\leq 0\}$$

	
	
the set of points in $R^{n}$ such that backwards in time was inside a ball surrounding $p$

### Theorem: Local stable/unstable manifolds for flows
Let $x' = f(x)$, $p$ and equilibrium point, $f$ smooth and assume $A = Df(p)$.

Assume $A$ has 
	- $d$ eigenvalues with negative real parts (strictly negative)  
	- $k$ eigenvalues with positive real part
and $E^{s}$, $E^{u}$ are the corresponding linear subspaces
> It could have eigenvalues with real part equal to 0

Then for $\varepsilon > 0$ small enough, $W^{s}_{loc} (\varepsilon)$, $W^{u}_{loc} (\varepsilon)$ are smooth manifolds of dimension $d$, $k$ and tangent to $E^{s}$ and $E^{u}$, respectively.

If $x\in W^{s}_{loc}(\varepsilon)$, then $\phi(t, x) \xrightarrow[t \to +\infty]{}p$
If $x\in W^{u}_{loc}(\varepsilon)$, then $\phi(t, x) \xrightarrow[t \to -\infty]{}p$

###### Global stable/unstable invariant manifolds
The global stable/unstable invariant manifolds are given by
$$\begin{align}
W^{s}(p) &= \{x\in \mathbb{R}^{n} \quad \phi(t, x) \to p \quad \textrm{as } t\to +\infty \} \\
W^{u}(p) &= \{x\in \mathbb{R}^{n} \quad \phi(t, x) \to p \quad \textrm{as } t\to -\infty \}
\end{align}$$
**How do we do it numerically?** 
- For the stable manifold, we take the local stable manifold and for each point we integrate it backward intime
- For the unstable manifold, we take the local unstable manifold and for each point we integrate it forward intime

##### Def: Homoclinic orbit
Given $p$ an equilibrim point, a homoclinic orbit of $p$ is an orbit $\phi(t, x)$ such that $$lim_{t\to \pm \infty} \phi(t, x) = p$$
or equivalently, $\phi(t, x) \in W^{s}(p) \cap W^{u}(p)$.

##### Def: Heteroclinic orbit
Given $p$, $q$ two equilibrim points, a heteroclinic orbit from $p$ to $q$ is an orbit $\phi(t, x)$ such that $$lim_{t\to + \infty} \phi(t, x) = p \qquad lim_{t\to - \infty} \phi(t, x) = q$$
or equivalently, $\phi(t, x) \in W^{u}(p) \cap W^{s}(q)$.

### Numerical computation
**Question**: *How do we proceed to compute numerically $W^{s, u}(p)$ ?*

###### Example 1: 1 dim manifold
Given $x' = f(x), \; x\in U \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $p$ an equilibrium point s.t.

$$A = Df(p) \textrm{ has } \begin{cases}
\lambda^{+}> 0, \, v^{+} \textrm{a unitary eigenvector} \\
\\ \\
\lambda^{-}< 0, \, v^{-} \textrm{a unitary eigenvector}
\end{cases}$$
**Unstable manifold**
We know that the eigenvector of the positive eigenvalue is tangent to the unstable manifold. We will consider two branches:
1. For $W^{u, +}(p)$: 
	1. Take initial condition $q = p+s\vec{v}^{+}$ (s small)
	2. Integrate *forward* in time
	3. Check for a specific poincaré map
	4. Repeat with different $s$ (so $s=1e-6, 1e-4, 1e-7$) and check that the computation is robust (this is a possible way to check)
For $W^{u, -}(p)$: 
	1. Take initial condition $q = p-s\vec{v}^{+}$ (s small)
	2.  Same as before...

**Stable manifold**
Same as before, we consider the two branches
1. For $W^{s, +}(p)$: 
	1. Take initial condition $q = p+s\vec{v}^{-}$ (s small)
	2. Integrate *backwards* in time
	3. Check robustness
For $W^{u, +}(p)$: 
	1. Take initial condition $q = p-s\vec{v}^{-}$ (s small)
	2.  Same as before...
