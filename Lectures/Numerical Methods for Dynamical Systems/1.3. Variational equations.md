# Variational equations
They appear when computing periodic orbits, or determine their stability, or when looking at the dependence on the initial conditions.

Consider a system of ODEs $$x' = f(x), \quad x\in U \subset \mathbb{R}^{n} \qquad \textrm{f is smoth}$$ and assume $\phi(t, x)$ is the solution such that $\phi(0, x) = x$ and $\frac{d}{dt}\phi(t, x) = f(\phi(t,x))$.

**Question**: How do you know $\phi(t, x+h)$ for small $h$? Can I know it exactly from the previous one?
"Yes", in the following sense:
Let's consider Taylor:
$$\phi(t, x+h) = \phi(t, x) + \frac{\partial\phi (t, x)}{\partial x}h + \frac{1}{2!}\frac{\partial^2\phi (t, x)}{\partial x^2} h^2$$To compute this, we need to know the partial derivatives. If $\phi$ is a vector, $\frac{\partial\phi (t, x)}{\partial x}$ will be a matrix and multiplied by $h$ will be a vector. The other term, $\frac{\partial^2\phi (t, x)}{\partial x^2} h^{2}$ is going to be $h^{T}Mh$...

$$ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} = \begin{pmatrix}  \frac{\partial \phi_1}{\partial x_{1}} & \dots & \frac{\partial \phi_1}{\partial x_{n}}\\\vdots & \dots & \vdots  \\ \frac{\partial \phi_n}{\partial x_{1}} & \dots & \frac{\partial \phi_n}{\partial x_{n}} \end{pmatrix}$$
And $\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}$ is going to be a box, each slice it's the previous derivative matrix but with an extra derivative:

$$ \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}_{first slice} = \begin{pmatrix}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\left(\frac{\partial \phi_1}{\partial x_{1}}\right) & \dots & \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\left(\frac{\partial \phi_1}{\partial x_{n}}\right)\\\vdots & \dots & \vdots  \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\left(\frac{\partial \phi_n}{\partial x_{1}}\right) & \dots & \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\left(\frac{\partial \phi_n}{\partial x_{n}}\right) \end{pmatrix}$$


Since $\phi$ is known, what we will need are the deravitves.

*How can we do that?*

**One possibility**: if $n = 2$ (*exercise: re-write for any n*)

$$\phi(t, x+h) = (\phi_t(t,x+h), \phi_2(t,x+h)), \quad x = (x_1,x_{2})\quad h = (h_1,h_2)$$
Take one component ($\phi_1$ or $\phi_2$):
$$ \begin{aligned}\psi: A \subset \mathbb{R}^{3} &\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \\ (t, x_1,x_{2}) &\longrightarrow \psi(t, x_{1}, x_{2})\end{aligned}$$
Then,
$$\psi(t, x+h) = \psi(t,x) + D\psi(t, x)h + \frac{1}{2!}D^{2}\psi(t,x)h^{2} + \frac{1}{3!}D^{3}\psi(t,x)h^{3} + \dots$$
with:
$$\begin{align*}
D\;\psi(t,x)\cdot h &= (h_{1}D_{1} + h_{2}D_{2})\psi(t,x) + h_{1}D_{1}\psi(t,x) + h_{2}D_{2}\psi(t,x)\\
D^{2}\psi(t, x)\;\cdot h^{2} &= (h_{1}D_{1}+ h_{2}D_{2})^2\psi(t, x)
= h_{1}^{2}D_{11}\psi(t,x) + 2h_{1}h_{2}D_{12}\psi(t,x) + h_{2}D_{22}\psi(t,x)\\
D^{3}\psi(t,x)\; \cdot h^{3} &= (h_{1}D_{1}+ h_{2}D_{2})^{3}\psi(t,x)\end{align*} $$

You would do taylor for each component. But we won't do this. Our idea is to compute the whole matrix in one step, the whole box in another step, etc.

**Another possibility** (the one we will use) is to compute the whole matrices in one single step by solving a system of ODE's.

###### Variational equations | definition
In particular, the system of ODE satisfied by $\frac{\partial\phi (t, x)}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}$, .. are called **variational equations**.

## Variational equations | derivation
Let us see how to obtain them

### First order variational equations

**For $\frac{\partial\phi (t, x)}{\partial x}$**, from 

$$\frac{d}{dt}\phi(t, x) = f(\phi(t,x))$$
we consider $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ (and recall that $x$, $t$ are independent variables):
$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\frac{d}{dt}\phi(t, x) = D f(\phi(t,x)) \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \phi(t, x)$$
Eq: S1

Here $D$ indicates derivative with respect $x$.

Since $t$ and $x$ are independent, we can change the order of the left-hand side

$$ \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\phi(t, x) = D f(\phi(t,x)) \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \phi(t, x)$$
We obtain a linear system of ODE (the variable to solve is what we want:  $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\phi(t, x)$).
We now need the initial conditions, which are also known:

$$\frac{\partial \phi(t, x)}{\partial x}|_{t=0} = I$$ (the identity matrix, since this $\phi(0, x) = x$).

How do we proceed numerically?
With our integrator we compute the solution $\phi$, but at the same time, we add:

$$\begin{aligned}\begin{pmatrix}a_{11} & \dots & a_{1n} \\ \vdots &  & \vdots \\ a_{n1} & \dots  & a_{nn}\end{pmatrix}' & = & \begin{pmatrix}D_{x_1}f_1 & \dots & D_{x_n}f_1 \\ \vdots &  & \vdots \\ D_{x_1}f_n & \dots & D_{x_n}f_n\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix}a_{11} & \dots & a_{1n} \\ \vdots &  & \vdots \\ a_{n1} & \dots  & a_{nn}\end{pmatrix} 
\\
 \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\phi(t, x) & = & D f(\phi(t,x)) & \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \phi(t, x)
\end{aligned}$$

So our ODE system will be
$$\begin{aligned}
x_{1}' &=f_1(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) \\
\vdots \\
x_{n}' &=f_n(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) \\
a_{11}' &= \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\partial f_1}{ \partial x_{k}}(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) a_{k1} \\
\vdots \\
a_{1n}' &= \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\partial f_1}{ \partial x_{k}}(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) a_{kn} \\
a_{n1}' &= \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\partial f_n}{ \partial x_{k}}(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) a_{k1} \\
\vdots \\
a_{nn}' &= \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\partial f_n}{ \partial x_{k}}(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) a_{kn}
\end{aligned}$$
And with initial conditions: $x_1(0) = x_{10}, \dots, x_{n}(0) = x_{n(0)}= x_{n0}$ and
$$(a_{ij})|_{t=0} = I_{n\times n}$$

You implement a new sistem with $n+n^2$ ODE variable.

You can also use instead of $a_{11} \rightarrow x_{n+1}$ for convenience (when you have to use your integrator).

### Second order variational equations
For $\frac{\partial^{2}\phi(t, x)}{\partial x^{2}}$.

From Eq. S1:

$$ \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial^2 \phi(t,x)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial\phi(t, x)}{\partial x} = D_{x} f(\phi(t,x)) \frac{\partial^{2}\phi(t, x)}{\partial x^{2}} + D_{xx}f(\phi(t,x))\left(\frac{\partial\phi(t, x)}{\partial x}\right)^2 $$
This is a nonhomogeneous linear system.

In particular, every term of the box will be:

$$\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial^{2} \phi_i(t,x)}{\partial x_{j}\partial x_{k}} = \sum\limits_{p, q=1}^{n} D_{pq}f_i(\phi(t,x)) \frac{\partial \phi_p(t,x)}{\partial x_{j}}\frac{\partial \phi_q(t,x)}{\partial x_{k}} + \sum\limits_{p=1}^{n} D_{p} f_{i}(\phi(t,x))\frac{\partial^{2}\phi_{p}(t,x)}{\partial x_{j}\partial x_{k}}$$

The initial conditions:

$$\frac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial x^{2}(t,x)}|_{t=0} = 0$$ since this is the time derivative of the previous initial conditions (which were the identity matrix, so a constant).

We will need to integrate $n+n^2+n^3$ ODE (variables)
