## Definitions
###### Discrete dynamical systems
Discrete dynamical systems are defined by maps (or by [[dipheomorfisms]] if we want to use $F^{-1}$). 
 > *Reminder: We always consider $F$ to be as smooth as it needs to be for our goals.* 

$$\begin{align}
F: U \subset &\mathbb{R}^{n} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}\\
&x \longrightarrow F(x)
\end{align}$$
We also have:
$$\begin{cases}
x_{o}: \textrm{given} \\
x_{n+1}=F(x_{n})
\end{cases}$$
**Notation**
- $F^{0}(x)=x, \quad F(x)=F(x), \qquad F^{2}(x)=F(F(x))$
- $F^{-1}=F^{-1}(x), \quad F^{-2}(x)=F^{-1}(F^{-1}(x))$

###### Related orbit
*Def:* Given an initial condition, its related orbit is the set
$$ \{F^i(x)\}_{i\in \mathbb{Z}}$$
###### Fixed point
*Def*: A fixed point is a point $x$ such that $F(x) = x$

##### m-periodic point
*Def*: An m-periodic point x is a point such that
$$ \begin{cases}F^{m}(x) = x \\ \\
F^{k}(x) \neq x \quad \textrm{if    } k<m
\end{cases}$$
the orbit is
$$orbit = \{x, F(x), F^2(x),\dots,F^{m-1}(x)\}$$

###### Invariant set
*Def*: A set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is invariant if 
$$ F^{n}(x) \in A, \, \forall n\in \mathbb{Z} \,\, \textrm{and} \,\, x\in A$$
## Case $n = 1$
$$ x \longrightarrow f(x)$$
Representation of the orbit:
- One possibility: vertical axis $x$ and horizontal one $n$ (see notes)
- Another possibility: we have $x$, $y$. We plot $y = x$ and $y = F(x)$ and we mark $x_0$ in the horizontal axis, draw a vertical line until it gets to the $y=f(x)$ curve, then draw a horizontal line until it matches the $y=x$ line and go back down. This is going to be $x_1$. Repeat.

##### Example: Finance. Stock exchange market
Assume we haev a stock with a price $P_{t}$ and the model to provide the price at time $t+1$ is given by $$P_{t+1}= a P_{t}- aP_{t}^{2} = a P_{t}(1- P_{t})$$ where $a > 0$ is a given parameter (related to the buying pressure) and we assume a normalized price, $P_{t}\in [0, 1]$.

We can write the model as

$$ x \longrightarrow f(x) = ax(1-x)$$
or $$\begin{cases}x_0 \\
x_{n+1}= f(x_n) \end{cases}$$
**Question**: How does the evolution of the price ($P_t$) depend on $a$?
> Let's do some simulations!
- For example, take $a=0.8$ and $P_{0}= 0.3$ (see slides fig38a.eps or drawing). You will lose money, since for any $P_0$, the price tends to 0.
- Now assume $a=2$. We have a fix point (around 0.6, where both curves meet). By iteration, a "steady state" or a "fair value price" of 0.6 is reached, i.e. prices converge to a single value ( $\forall P_{0} \in (0,1)$) .
![[discrete_dynsys_finance]]
- Assume $a = 3.2$. In this case, there are 2 possible fair prices and the system oscillates between them. If I take the fix point, I stay there, but if not, I'll tend to the periodic orbit. There exist a 2 periodic point. (Provar a casa)
- Increasing $a$, there appear 4, 8, 16, 32... possible fair prices. (Plot with a bifurcation diagram, the typical one with chaos). It's a *cascade bifurcation diagram*.
*Conclusion*: As far as $a$ increases, the system cannot agree on what the fair prices are, so the prices fluctuates in a seemingly random, chaotic way. 


To solve a system of ODE:
$$\begin{cases}\vec x' = \vec f(t, \vec x) \\
\vec x(t_{0})= \vec x_0 \end{cases}$$
The unique solution is $\vec x(t)$. The **goal** is to get a numerical solution of the system

#### Homework
You need:
- Integrator (as a black box).  
	- Work with double precision. The absolute error and the relative error should be $1e-15$.
	- *Matlab*: e.g. ode45.
	- *C*: taylor ([info](https://www.maia.ub.es/~angel/taylor/))

Typically:
- input: $f$, $t_0$, $\vec x_{0}=\vec x(t_0)$, $t_{final}$ and direction ($1$ forward in time and $-1$, backward).
- output: $(t_{final}, x(t_{final}))$ and you can save (or not) the intermediate points

Sometimes:
- input $np$: number of points. You have $t_0$, $t_{final}$ and $\Delta t$
- output: $x(t_{0}) = x_0$, $x(t_{1}) = x(t_{0}+\Delta t)$...

The relative and absolute tolerance error will always be $10^{-15}$ or $10^{-16}$.

If professor wants $x(\pi)$, $x(3.14)$ is not acceptable. We need 16 digits (dobule precision)
