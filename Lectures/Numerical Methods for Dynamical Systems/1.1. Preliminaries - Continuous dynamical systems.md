# Preliminaries: Continuous dynamical systems
We have an autonomous system of ODEs

$$ \vec{x}' = \vec{f} (\vec{x}) = \begin{cases} x_1' = f_1(x_1, \dots, x_n) \\ x_n' = f_n(x_1, \dots, x_n)\end{cases}
$$
We assume $\vec{f}$ smoth enough and we use $x = \vec{x}$, $f = \vec{f}$.

The **associated flow** is $\phi_t(x) = \phi(t,x)$ such that we have the following


Cauchy problem $\begin{cases}\frac{d\phi_t(x)}{dt} = f(\phi_t(x)) \\ \phi_0(x) = x \end{cases}$

The initial notation at $t=0$ is $x$. We will use the following notation:
$$ \phi_t(t_{0,}x) = \phi(t; t_{0,}x) = \phi_{t0}(t, x)$$
Another notation: $x(t, t_{0,}x_0)$
$$\frac{dx(t; t_0,x_0)}{dt} = f(x(t; t_{0,}x_{0})$$$$x(t; t_{0}, x_{0}) = x_{0}$$
###### Def: Equilibrium point
An equilibrium point is a point $\vec{e}$ such that $\vec{f}(\vec{e}) = 0$. Then $\phi_{t}(\vec{e})=\vec{e} \qquad \forall t$ is a solution.

###### Def: Periodic orbit
$\phi_{t}(x)$ is T-periodic if $\phi_{0}(x) = \phi_{T}(x)= x$ and $\phi_{t}(x) \neq x$ for $0 < t< T$.

###### Def: Invariant set
$A \subset \mathcal{R}^n$ is invariant for system if for any $x\in A$, the solution passing through $x$ belongs to $A$.

##### Remark
Consider a *non autonomous* system of ODE
$$ \vec{x}' = \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = g(t, \vec{x}), \quad t \in I \subset \mathcal R, \quad \vec{x}\in U \subset \mathcal R^{n}$$we may consider an *autonomous* system of ODE defining
$$ \vec{y} = (t, \vec{x}) = (t, x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) = (y_{0}, y_{1}, \dots, y_{n})$$
and
$$ \vec{y}' = \vec{G}(\vec{y}) \quad \textrm{or} \quad 
\begin{cases}y_{0}' = 1 \\ y_{1}' = g_{1}(t, x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) \\ \dots \\ y_{n}' =g_{n(t}, x_{1}, \dots, x_{n})\end{cases}$$
## Motivating examples
## Case n = 1
$$ x' = \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x) \quad x\in \mathcal R^{n}$$
If $n = 1$, $\frac{dx}{dt}= f(x) \leftrightarrow \int{\frac{dx}{f(x)}} = \int{dt} = t + C$ 

**Approaches**
- *1st.* To compute the analytical expression of all the solutions (not trivial): compute $\int{\frac{dx}{f(x)}}$.
- *2nd*. Qualitative or geometric behavior of all the solutions.
	1.  Compute the zeros of $f(x) = 0$.
	2. Compute the sign of $f(x)$ in the corresponding intervals.
$$\begin{cases}x' = x^{2}\\ x(0) = x_{0}\end{cases}$$ the analytical expression is $$x(t, x_0)= \frac{x_{0}}{1-x_{0}t}$$

Exercise $x' = sin(x)$. 

## Case n = 2
$$\begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$$

There are 14 different examples.

### **A pendulum**
$$\begin{cases} F = m a \\ ml \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^{2}}= - mg \sin{\theta}\end{cases}$$We can write a system with $x = \begin{pmatrix} \theta' \\ \theta' \end{pmatrix} =  \begin{pmatrix} \theta' \\ \omega \end{pmatrix}$.
$$\begin{cases} \theta' = \omega \\ \omega '= - \frac{g}{l} \sin{\theta}\end{cases}$$
This system has a [[First integral|first integral]]

 $$H(\theta, \omega) = \frac{ml^{2}\omega^{2}}{2} + mgl(1-\cos{\theta})$$ (the energy)

We need to check
$$\frac{dH}{dt}(\theta(t), \omega(t)) = \frac{\partial H}{\partial\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt} + = \frac{\partial H}{\partial\omega} \frac{d\omega}{dt} = mgl\omega\sin{\theta} + ml^{2}{\omega(-\frac{g}{l}\sin{\theta})} = 0$$We simply need to plot $H(\theta, \omega) = constant$, that is, the level curves of $H(\theta, \omega)$.

- If $E=0$, equilibrium point
- If $E \in (0, 2mgl)$, periodic orbits
- If $E = 2mgl$, a [[Separatrix]] or heteroclinic orbit (check if it's exactly the same or not)
- If $E > 2mgl$, full rounds

### Predator-prey problem
*Examples: sharks-fish, lions-zebra, lynx-rabbits*...
- $x(t)$: population of predators
- $y(t)$: population of predators

The system of ODEs for $a, b, \alpha, \beta > 0$.

$$\begin{cases}
x' = -bx + \alpha xy = x(-b + \alpha y) \\
y' = ay - \beta xy = y(a - \beta y)
\end{cases}$$
Equilibrium points:
- Saddle $(0, 0)$
- Center $(\frac{a}{\beta}, \frac{b}{\alpha})$
First integral (you cannot know a priori, with mechanics is energy, but otherwise is unknown)
$$V(x, y) = \beta x - a \ln{x} + \alpha y - b \ln{y} $$

###### Another model of predator-prey
$$\begin{cases}x' = -x + 3xy \\
y' = 3y(1-y) - xy -\lambda(1-e^{5y})\end{cases}$$
$0 < \lambda$ paramter depending on eternal conditions (food supply, environment properties, ...).

**Goal**: To know the equilibrium points. They depend on $\lambda$ and they're plotted in the slides. Bifurcations appear.

##### Chaos
**Def**: High sensitivity with respect to the initial conditions.

###### 3D-Lorenz system
$$\begin{cases}\frac{dx}{dt}= \sigma (y-x) \\
\frac{dy}{dt}= x(r -z) - y \\
\frac{dz}{dt}= xy -bz \end{cases}$$
In the particular case of $\sigma = 10$, $r = 28$, $b=8/3$ .

###### Double pendulum

### Celestial mechanics
The branch of the astronomy (classical mechanics and maths) that deals with the motions in outer space in terms of the gravitational effects amont the bodies involved.

#### The N-body problem
$N$ masses.

The equations of motion are
$$m_{i}\frac{d^{2}\vec{q}_{i}}{dt^{2}} = \sum\limits_{j = 1, j \neq i}^{N} \frac{Gm_{i}m_{j}(\vec q_{j}- \vec q_{i})}{||{\vec q_{j} - \vec q_{i}||}^{3}}\quad\textrm{for } i = 1, \cdots, N$$
For $N = 2$, we know everything: we can have elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic orbits. The elliptic orbit is periodic. The parabolic arrives to infinity with velocity 0 and the hyperbolic arrives at infinity with positive velocity.

With this simple case, you can explain
- Planets around the Sun
- Asteroids
- Comets.

For space missions, with more sophisticated trajectories, $n=2$ is not enough. 

#### $N=3$ 
You can consider earth, sun and spacecraft. Here we have no idea of the general solution. What can we do? Let's consider $n=3$ with some particular conditions: restriced three-body problem (RTBP).

The idea is: let's assume we have only 2 bodies (with known movement, since they can only be ciruclar, parbolic, hhyperbolic). For example, earth and moon. Now we add a third body, for example a spacecraft, which has an infinitessimal mass (small compared to the other ones, $m_{3}\approx 0$). The motion of $P_{3}$ will depend on $P_1$ and $P_2$, but their motion, won't depend on $P_1$ .

The "big" masses are called *primaries*.

We have different possibilities:
- Circular RTBP
- Elliptic RTBP
- Parabolic RTBP
- Hyperbolic RTBP

We can take a simplified model, where all the bodies are in the same plan. We can take new coordinates, $\eta$ and $\xi$, such that they rotate together with the primaries ($P_1$ and $P_2$). So $P_1$ and $P_2$ will remain fix at all time.

In this case, we have a system of equations (to see in the future). We start by the simplest solutions: the equilibrium points. For this problem we have 5 equilibrium points and this has manny applications.

(We will reduced masses to $u = \frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}$.)

#### Genesis mission (2001 - 2004)
The idea was to take the sun and earth as primaries. The idea was to send an spacecraft from Earth to the Halo orbits, collect some data, and then come back to the arth.

Why do we follow specific trajectories? The answer lies on the 5 equilibrium points. You can create a trajectory so that you don't need any fuel. We follow the cheapest, the optimized one.

What do you compute?
1. Equilibrium points
2. Periodic orbits (PO)
3. Invariant manifolds of the periodic orbit. This means the full set of orbits tending to this periodic orbit. They are going to tend asymptotically to the periodic orbit.  
It's not a realy problem but it provides a really good insight into the real one.

###### Artemis-P1 spacecrafts orbit
We take as primaries Earth and moon. We play with L1 and L2. You compute the invariant manifold of one orbit and the other and you compute the intersection

In this case we have heteroclinic orbits ubt instead of starting/ending at equlibirium points, they do it with periodic orbits.

##### Galaxies
What happens when galaxies become closer? We can get bridges and tails with simulations as well. For some cases, $m_1$ and $m_3$  interchange mass.

### Microscopic problem
*Example*: Atoms dynamics, Hidrogen atom. We can consider it from the mechanical space of view.
