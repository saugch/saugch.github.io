**Teaching methodology**
By block,
- Introductory sessions: basics in the topic and statement of short-projects (*groups of 3*)
- Short-projects:
	- work in class and outside
	- present in front of class with slides (to be delivered and shared with students)
	- most important thing: communicate what the project about and the main results (not as specific as an exam)
	- report to be submitted (later on)
- wrap -up session: reveiw the basics, including things presented in the mini-projects.
Each block takes around **6 sessions**.

**Software and programming**
- Matlab, python, C... - free to use the software you are more comfortable.
- XPP/AUTO: specific for neuroscience.

**Teaching resources**
Everything in ATENEA. We can ask for books to the professors (they cannot put them in Atenea)

**Qualification system**
- 50%: Based on the mini-projects (by weight)
- 20%: Individual evaulation depending on participation:
	- Implication in the projects, questions to classmates, etc.
- Final exam (January 9th):
	- 5 questions per block that will be provided at the end of each block (5 x 5 = 25 questions in the pool). You can prepare them in advance.
	- For the exam, they will choose 5 questions.
	- The material will include the topics introduced in class *and also from the reports of our classmates.*

## Intro to the blocks
### Populations dynamics
Mathematical models to understand the dynamics of populations and predict their evolutions (ecology, epidemoiology)

#### Mathematical aspects
**Types of modeling**
- Models of differential equations
- Discrete dynamical systems

**Methodological aspects**
- Dynamical Systems techniques
- Computational tools

**Concepts**
- Equilibrium points
- Periodoc orbits
- Bifurcations of low codimension
- Data fitting

### Computational neuroscience
#### Basics
We work with neurons and synapsis: spans large temporal and spatial scales

**Spatial scales of the brain**
- Whole brain
- Cortical area
- Local network or column
- Neuron
- Sub-cellular compartements
- Molecules

**Blocks**
We will have to courses on neuroscience:
- Single cell neurophysiology
- Neuronal networks: firing rate models and mean field equations - working memory, decision making and perceptual bistability
