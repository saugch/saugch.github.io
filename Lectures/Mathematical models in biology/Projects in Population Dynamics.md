## Introduction
Each paper has a paper, where they discuss a problem coming from species, demographics, etc. They present the problem and then describe the mathematical model

We need to identify what do the parameters and the variables mean (biological meaning) and then study the dynamics. What happens when you change a paramter, etc. We may also need to study some bifurcations. Do a bit more than what's done in the project
